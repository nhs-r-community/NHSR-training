This website contains course and training information.

Instructor led courses that are provided through The Strategy Unit (part of NHS Midlands & Lancashire Commissioning Support Unit) have summaries and prework.

Other (free) self led or archived courses are listed together. 
This won't be a comprehensive list and recommendations/corrections are always welcome.

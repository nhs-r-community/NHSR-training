The concepts covered in the course, and even some function names, will be familiar to those who use SQL and this course is aimed at those who have not used R/RStudio before or used only very little of it (perhaps running other peopleâ€™s work for example). As we work through the course we will be using and exploring Quarto to see how reports that mix text and code can be produced in R as well as be used as a way of managing analysis workflow."
